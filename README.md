### QnA.
https://cryptic-depths-63828.herokuapp.com

My **second** project at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) Course.
* **What It Is**: Question and Answer app that allows users to post and view questions in realtime.

* **What It Can Be**:  A *Forum*, *Poll*, further developed into a simple *Social Network*, you get the idea...

* **Inspiration**: *Quora*, *Padlet*

## User stories: Dream vs Reality
![userStories](userStories.jpg)

The above was conceptualized during the planning stage. As of now, users can:

* Login, logout locally and via facebook (feature currently down as fb deems webapp malicious...)

* Post, view Questions and Answers

* View simple user stats

## Additional features I would have liked to have done for this project

* User to be able to manage ie. view, update, delete their questions and answers on their profile page

* 'Like' and 'follow' buttons on the questions to generate top or followed qns for specific users

* Flash messages upon wrong passwords or taken up usernames/ emails

Unfortunately...
